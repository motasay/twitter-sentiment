    Features:
    1: count of positive
    2: count of negative
    3: count of intensity words: very good, so cool
    4: count of elongated words: greeeeat, sooo good
    5: has a question mark
    6: has exclamation mark
    7: has exclamation repeated more than once!!!
    8: contains hashtag
    
    If you're interested in the usefulness of each of these,
    the following are the coefficients for a logistic regression
    model for the negative, neutral, and positive classes respectively
    [[ 0.35346987  4.92481448  1.80200111  2.88740596  1.34519168 -0.06794115

    So many interesting insights can be seen from these. e.g.
    see how the coefficient of the hashtag is so big and leans
    toward classifying the tweet as positive?
